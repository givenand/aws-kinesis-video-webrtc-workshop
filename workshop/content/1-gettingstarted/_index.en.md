In this workshop you will learn about Amazon Kinesis Video Streams WebRTC features. You will learn how to compile the WebRTC C SDK samples, and modify the samples to integrate with AWS IoT. There are also labs that will help demonstrate how you can integrate KVS WebRTC streams into your web or mobile applications, as well as how to integrate your video streams into Amazon Echo Show capable devices.

## Requirements

This workshop makes use of AWS Cloud9 to build and run certain labs, as well as to make use of tools pre-installed on Cloud9 instances such as the AWS CLI. You will need to first configure an AWS Cloud9 instance in order to participate.

You will also need an AWS account with permissions for Kinesis Video Streams, Cloud9, and access to the AWS Management Console. You will also need permissions to create security credentials that permit programmatic access to AWS to run the sample applications. These are generally referred to as an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key pair.

There are optional labs that you can take advantage of if you have access to an Amazon Echo Show capable device, and if you have access to your physical devices such as a Raspberry Pi v4.

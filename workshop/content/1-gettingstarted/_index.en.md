In this workshop you will learn about Amazon Kinesis Video Streams WebRTC features. This workshop will demonstrate how to setup a WebRTC feed from multiple types of source videos and utilizing Kinesis Video Streams to display in your web or mobile application. There is an additional workshop to demonstrate how to integrate with the [AWS Connected Mobility Solution](https://aws.amazon.com/automotive/solutions/connected-mobility/) which is a reference architecture for accelerating building your fleet platform.

WebRTC is an open technology specification for enabling real-time communication (RTC) across browsers and mobile applications via simple APIs. It uses peering techniques for real-time data exchange between connected peers and provides low latency media streaming required for human-to-human interaction.  

## Requirements

This workshop makes use of AWS Cloud9 to build and run certain labs, as well as to make use of tools pre-installed on Cloud9 instances such as the AWS CLI. You will need to first configure an AWS Cloud9 instance in order to participate.

You will also need an AWS account with permissions for Kinesis Video Streams, Cloud9, and access to the AWS Management Console. You will also need permissions to create security credentials that permit programmatic access to AWS to run the sample applications. These are generally referred to as an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key pair.

There are optional labs that you can take advantage of if you have access to your physical devices such as a Raspberry Pi 4, an iOS device or an Android device.

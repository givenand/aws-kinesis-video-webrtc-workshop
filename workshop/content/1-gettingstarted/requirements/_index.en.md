This workshop requires an AWS account with permissions for Kinesis Video Streams, Cloud9, and AWS Management Console.  You will also need the permissions to create security credentials that permit programmatic access to AWS to run the sample applications.  These are generally referred to as an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key pair.

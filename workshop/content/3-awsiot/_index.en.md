In this section of the workshop, you will learn how to make use of AWS IoT services in order to securely provision your devices using X.509 Certificates instead of using hard-coded AWS Access Key Pairs. You will also learn how to take advantage of other important aspects of integrating your devices with AWS IoT services, such as Device Management and Monitoring capabilities.

There are different considerations for working with a single device as compared to preparing hundreds, thousands, or even millions of devices for a production deployment. This workshop will focus on quickly enabling development teams to provision single devices as AWS IoT Things, and will point to helpful resources to consider as you prepare for production deployments.

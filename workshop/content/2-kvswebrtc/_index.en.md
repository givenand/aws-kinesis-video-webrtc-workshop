In this workshop you will learn about Amazon Kinesis Video Streams WebRTC features.  You will learn how to compile the WebRTC C SDK samples on an AWS Cloud 9 instance. You will then run the one of the sample applications from the Cloud 9 instance, which will generate a simulated video stream that you can view in the AWS Console.

Alternatively, you may elect to run this workshop on your own device hardware. We do not provide specific instructions on how to run these steps on every single hardware platform available, but instructions are provided for running this workshop on a v4 Raspberry Pi device. A specific bill of materials used for that aspect of the workshop are provided there.

All subsequent labs are then expected to be followed with the assumption that you are building on whatever device hardware you may chose for this portion of the workshop.

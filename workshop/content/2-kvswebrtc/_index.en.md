In this section, you will build the producer video streams on your selected source device.  For the Cloud9 instance, since it is complicated to hook up a camera to an EC2 instance, we will run a sample video feed.  For the other devices (Rasbpery Pi, iOS and Android) the user should be able to produce a real-time video stream to their application in the cloud.

Alternatively, you may elect to run this workshop on your own device hardware. We do not provide specific instructions on how to run these steps on every single hardware platform available, but instructions are provided for running this workshop on a Raspberry Pi device. A specific bill of materials used for that aspect of the workshop are provided there.

All subsequent labs are then expected to be followed with the assumption that you are building on whatever device hardware you may chose for this portion of the workshop.
